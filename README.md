# Intro:
Data structure means to organise data in more efficient form for eg [4,8,2] to [2,4,8].
This can be done by using algorithms. Algorithm is a step or process to arrange data.
Data structure are of 2 types Primitive and Non Primitive structure 

* Primitive: Integer, float, character and pointer

* Non primitive: Arrays, List and Files
* List: linear and nonlinear lists 
* Linear: stacks and queues
* Nonlinear: Graphs and trees

# Operation of DS:
Traversing, Insertion, Deletion, Searching, Sorting and Merging

Other: Array, stack, Queue, tree, graph, insertion, recursion, search, sorting, merge, map and set

Logical part: nested loops, low and highest values, objects, update specific value
